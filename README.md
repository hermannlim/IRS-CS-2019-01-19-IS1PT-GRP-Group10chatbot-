# SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
In recent years, due to fields such as artificial intelligence and data having been
identified as upcoming strategic technological trends, and in line with Singaporeâ€™s vision
to be a Smart nation of the future, the government has been pushing to train more
professionals in the areas of artificial intelligence, data analytics and software
engineering. Many people are looking for courses and training in those fields, which the
Institute of System Science provides.

The Institute of System Science (ISS) is an institution that provides graduate and
executive education for graduates and working professionals. It provides programmes
and courses in Information Technology, Data Analytics, and Leadership in the
Infocomm sector. ISS has also been appointed the National Continuing Education &amp;
Training (CET) Institute (NCI) for the National Infocomm Competency Framework
(NICF) by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) and the Infocomm Media Development
Authority of Singapore (IMDA).

With the multitude of courses offer by ISS, the visitors of the website might find it a
hassle to navigate through all of the information provided on the website. The institute
has therefore proposed that a chatbot system be implemented, so as to create a more
user-friendly way for them to navigate and search for the information on the website.

Our project group of 3 members has developed a chatbot system where the user will be
able to use natural language to interact with the chatbot. To build the chatbot system,
we used Google Dialogflow to detect the intent of the queries, as well as Heroku to
contain our solution files. For the user interface, we have implemented two alternatives.
To interact with the chatbot, the user has the option of using the default web interface of
Dialogflow, or through the program Slack interface.

Our team learned a lot in the process of working on this project. We managed to apply
concepts such at Intents that we learned in our lectures, as well as technical skills
learned from workshops like chatbot building and making use of webhooks in a
business application scenario.
